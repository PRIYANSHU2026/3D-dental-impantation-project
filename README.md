The project aims to develop a software application for displaying DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files in a 3D visual format, specifically focusing on visualizing nerves. The software utilizes Python libraries such as Pydicom for handling DICOM files, VTK (Visualization Toolkit) for generating 3D visualizations, and Matplotlib for additional plotting capabilities.

This collaboration project is intended for publication in a journal, highlighting the use of these libraries in medical imaging applications. The software's primary goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing DICOM images in a 3D environment, enhancing the visualization and analysis of nerve structures.
